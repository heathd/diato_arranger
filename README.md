Diato Arranger
==============

This program will take an ABC music file as input and output an arrangment of that tune for G/C diatonic accordeon (melodeon).

Todo list
---------

1. Pay attention to key signature
2. Output module, generate a readable basic HTML output initially.
3. Command line tool
4. Simple web app:
  - accept abc copy+pasted into form
  - on submission, generate random hash code ala piratepad, bitly etc to allow reference/editing
  - show generated output (html)
5. If a tune can't be played in its written key, analyse and suggest a transposition which would be playable.
